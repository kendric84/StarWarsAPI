## Summary
A fun app that allows you to view all the characters from the Star Wars Galaxy.

The app pulls data from a public Star Wars API and displays the characters name, date of birth, height, mass, homeworld, and species.

This was my first project utilizing an API and asyncronys functions. It was a fun and challenging project. Understanding how anysc and await work together will be very beneficial in future projects.
